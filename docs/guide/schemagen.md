# The SchemaGen TFX Pipeline Component

Some TFX components use a description of your input data called a *schema*. The
schema is an instance of
[schema.proto](
https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/blob/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/schema.proto).
A schema specifies data types for feature values,
whether a feature has to be present in all examples, allowed value ranges, and
other properties. A `SchemaGen` pipeline component will automatically generate a
schema by inferring types, categories, and ranges from the training data. However, this auto-generated
schema is best-effort and only tries to infer basic properties of the data. It is expected that developers 
review and modify it as needed.

* Consumes: Statistics from a `StatisticsGen` component
* Output: A data schema proto

Here's an excerpt from a schema proto:

```proto
...
feature {
  name: "age"
  value_count {
    min: 1
    max: 1
  }
  type: FLOAT
  presence {
    min_fraction: 1
    min_count: 1
  }
}
feature {
  name: "capital-gain"
  value_count {
    min: 1
    max: 1
  }
  type: FLOAT
  presence {
    min_fraction: 1
    min_count: 1
  }
}
...
```

The following TFX libraries use the schema generated by `SchemaGen`:

*   TensorFlow Data Validation
*   TensorFlow Transform
*   TensorFlow Model Analysis

In a typical TFX pipeline, SchemaGen generates a schema which is consumed by the
other pipeline components.


## SchemaGen and TensorFlow Data Validation

SchemaGen makes extensive use of the [TensorFlow Data Validation](tfdv.md) library for inferring a schema

## Using the SchemaGen Component

A SchemaGen component is typically very easy to deploy and requires little
customization. Typical code looks like this:

```python
from tfx import components

...

infer_schema = components.SchemaGen(
    statistics=computed_training_statistics.outputs['statistics'])
```
